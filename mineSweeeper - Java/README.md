This project is about replicating the classic Minesweeper game. The project is not yet complete, although it has all the needed functionalities: it opens the empty neighbor squares, it implements chord functionality when the numbered square is surrounded by the correct amount of flags, and the game resets itself after all blocks are opened or a mine is found. I will continue to work on this project to implement different difficulty levels and make it more visually appealing.
